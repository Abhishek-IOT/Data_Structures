"""
find duplicate in an array of N+1 Integers
Traverse the given array from start to end.
For every element in the array increment the arr[i]%nâ€˜th element by n.
Now traverse the array again and print all those indices i for which arr[i]/n is greater than 1.
Which guarantees that the number n has been added to that index.
USing the hashmap approach we can solve this problem
